# About new site of Rūrusetto

New site of Rūrusetto is planned for a month now since the codebase is expanding and some function of website is not support by Hugo (static website generator that we use to make a current site.) That's why we fix this problem why make a new repository of already build website and use the main repository as dev version of website.

# Q&A

Q : What's new in a new version of Rūrusetto?
A : The team is talking and working on a new scope of the new website. (At least, it's not a static website anymore.)
